# El

**El** is a Discord bot that has a goal of being extensible, open and free of charge.

I believe that one bot should be enough to provide all functionality you need on your server. Having to know how to use all your bots that often double features of each other.

Being open source is also a major advantage of El. It not only allows programmers to report vulnerablities and add things they miss, it also ensures that you don't need to pay for features - El will always remain 100% free of charge (though we might accept donations someday).

El is still in early development. Don't except much yet.
